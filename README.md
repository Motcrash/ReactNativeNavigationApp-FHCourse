# ReactNativeNavigationApp-FHCourse

A Navigation test app project following the React native course of Fernando Herrera, this is just a simple project to learn React Native basics

If you want to try the app just download the project and execute the following command

# Running the aplication

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Execute the metro server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of the project:

```bash
# On android
npx react-native run-android
# On IOS
npx react-native run-ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
